										the experienced developers who are my peers.

									<h2>Recreation</h2>
									<p>
										In my free time, I've been overjoyed to explore the incredible wilderness that
										Montana has to offer. I've found the serenity at the peak of a mountain, the
										adrenaline while climbing or rafting, and the "good 'ole days" of camping
										with friends. Montana has deepened my love for the outdoors and created
										and even stronger sense of adventure within me!
